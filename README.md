# 100 Days of RTL
A tracker showing my progress with applying SystemVerilog fundamentals. My goal is to strengthen my skills for future projects!      
For the first 21 days, I followed [QuickSilicon's course](https://quicksilicon.in/course/21daysofrtl), which allowed me to quickly test my solutions against my test benches and view their waveforms in Surfer. Afterwards, I tested my code in Xilinx Vivado.
