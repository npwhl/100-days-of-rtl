# Day 8 Notes
A one-hot is a way of displaying FSM states as a numbered bit location (ex. state 1 = 01, state 2 = 10, etc.).      
Bit shifts help with having the correct 0's on both sides!! (think bit shifts for "placing" a  bit)     
use localparam for tb and specify in tb          
random is urandom_range!!
