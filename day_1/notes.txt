Initially tried to do an always case, but didn't consider
the wires in the module definition. 
Typically don't want to store in a mux and simply pass
values along, so you can't procedurally assign wires. They
are only assigned at one spot and will change whenever the 
wires change (the value is constantly flowing).

Need to use register at the highest spot the variable
will be used (will typically be stored here).
But sysverilog has logic which can behave as both so it's 
better to use it...?

wires are good for transitions too...!

(.*); = same name, same assignment
$urandom_range = random unsigned

write test benches in an initial block to have the ability
to use time #10, #50...
